# CW-7072
Code repository for 7072 course work
There are three folders in this repository.
 -Logistic regression folder contains code for logical regression 
  and input data file which prepares data for machine learning.
  By running log_reg_main file,result can be seen.

 -LDA contains code for linear discriminant Analysis code. lda_main should be run 
  to get the result.
 -SVM folder has code for support vector machine. 
  svm_main should be run to get the output.
 -LS_2.0 is the input file taken from kaggle.com.
 -After applying python code to prepare data for ML techniques,
  LS_2.0 is converted into LS_2.0_output and this file is used to execute the code.
